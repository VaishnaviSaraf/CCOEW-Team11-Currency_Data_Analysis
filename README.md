Users should have the option to select weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly charts. The dashboard should also display the date on which the rate was at its peak (highest) and the date on which it was at its lowest. Users should be able to print the data in a chart. Input will be currency exchange rate dataset between a currency pair and will be provided in a file format Use USD as Base Currency where first currency will always be USD and second currency will be variable. For instance, currency pairs could be USD/INR, USD/GBP, USD/EUR, USD/CAD etc. ```
